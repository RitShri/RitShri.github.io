			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p><b>Robot Open Autonomous Racing:</b> Led by its faculty members with deep expertise in AI and autonomous driving, the Robot Open Autonomous Racing (ROAR) competition is a new AI racecar competition hosted in Berkeley starting in 2020. Multiple student racing teams compete for speed and vehicle skills at the heart of the iconic Berkeley campus. 
 The participating teams adopt the set of common 1/10 RC car hardware as regulated by a rules committee. The regulations aim to ensure the competition to be affordable and fair to our target students. Different teams are allowed to upgrade their car hardware as permitted by the regulation and to develop and deploy their own autonomous driving software. 
			<br> Ritika is a student researcher working to develop a standardized racing platform for all racers. For this purpose, Ritika has worked to develop the localization module and code, so that each race car is able to map its location on the race track. Ritika is also working on object detection for real-time avoidance of static and dynamic obstacles. This include developing an algorithm for ground plane detection.
