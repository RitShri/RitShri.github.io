			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p><b><a href="https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/research1/roar/">Robot Open Autonomous Racing:</a></b> Led by its faculty members with deep expertise in AI and autonomous driving, the Robot Open Autonomous Racing (ROAR) competition is a new AI racecar competition hosted in Berkeley starting in 2020. Multiple student racing teams compete for speed and vehicle skills at the heart of the iconic Berkeley campus. 
 The participating teams adopt the set of common 1/10 RC car hardware as regulated by a rules committee. The regulations aim to ensure the competition to be affordable and fair to our target students. Different teams are allowed to upgrade their car hardware as permitted by the regulation and to develop and deploy their own autonomous driving software. 
			<br> <br> Ritika is a student researcher working to develop a standardized racing platform. For this purpose, Ritika has worked to develop the localization module and code, so that each race car is able to map its location on the race track. Ritika is also working on object detection for real-time avoidance of static and dynamic obstacles. This include developing an algorithm for ground plane detection.

			<p><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/eecs-c106a-final-rps-gp30/home?authuser=0">Cable-Actuated Hand:</a></b> Project by students where they design and implement a functional, cable-actuated robotic hand, which is itself an on-going research topic in academia. Most robotic hands lack the potential for delicate motion and control. For example, while a Baxter robot is capable of grasping, it is unsuited for tasks that require varying amounts of force and sensitivity. To approach this issue, we decided to use a bio-inspired design that uses cables to mimic human tendons. 
			<br> <br> Ritika is a primary worker on this project. She built the hand, designed the software, and programmed the computer vision algorithm to identify the human-player's hand and the algorithm to allow the robotics hand to play against the human.
